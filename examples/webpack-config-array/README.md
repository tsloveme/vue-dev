# Webpack config array

```shell
node ../../bin/webpack-dev-server.js --open
```

This opens the app with two webpack configs.

## What should happen

The script should open `http://localhost:8080/`. It should display "It's working" with a dotted background.

Browsing to `http://localhost:8080/bundle2.js` should show a minified JS bundle.
