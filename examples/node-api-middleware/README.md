# Node.js API - Middleware

```shell
node server.js
```

Starts a webpack-dev-server setup via the Node API. Open `http://localhost:8080/` to go the app.

## What should happen

In the app you should see "It's working."

In the CLI, you should see this for each refresh in the browser:

```
Using middleware for /
Using middleware for /bundle.js
```
